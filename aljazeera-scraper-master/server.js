//Optimized with
/*
 * all routes and controllers should be imported to reduce cluter on server file 
 *create Scripts folder for general functions
 * Use the global.process.env for attaching the app to ports and accessing databases  //deployment flexibility
 * use Node.js Cluster and PM2 to run several core process at once, for better performance
 * Specify an external service dependency to link to a remote load-balancer (protected database cluster)  //performance
 * use load balancing algorithims with the load balancer (Round Robin)
 * (on Aljazeera Scraper App, use Redis to improve MongoDB load performance; in-memory cache to reduce acess latency)
 * Optimize Mongoose queries (auto indexes generated)   //quickly find documents 
 * Log all errors with Morgan or Winston  // rely on verbose error loging to catch and correct all errors
 * use Query Helper methods to add functionality and avoid unnecessary repated code on querries   //neatly add querry functionality
 * Use Mocha for testing; include a test folder (Unit test)
 * possibly use Async and Await instead of promises - make asynchrounous code seem a little more synchronous
 * place routes in separate module and import
