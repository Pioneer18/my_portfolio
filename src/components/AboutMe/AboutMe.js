                    <p>I am passionate about web design &amp; creating IoT web applications and systems. Like many developers, I gained my foundational skills by obsessively tinkering with microcontrollers for hours in my garage. In order to springboard my skills beyond the level of a DIY hacker I received an AS in Engineering Technology at Hillsborough Community College, and earned a full-stack web developer certification from the Trilogy Education Servicesâ€™ Coding Boot Camp at the University of Central Florida.</p>
