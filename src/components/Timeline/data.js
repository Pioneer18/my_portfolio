However, by my senior year, I decided against pursuing a political career and began searching for other possible career paths. During my final semester of college I took an introduction to Python course and found that I am far more interested in technology than politics.",

        text: "After graduating from W&L I was still unsure of what to do with my recently sparked interest in programming, so I chose to teach English in Japan for a year. While teaching, exploring, and soaking up the experiences of Japan, I began to study HTML and CSS as well as revisit all the excercises in my Python textbook. I relied on resources like Udemy, Codecademy, and Khan Academy to dive deeper into programming fundamentals, and I also discovered a new interest in Arduinos by reading coding blogs and forums. I wasn’t sure that programming microcontrollers could lead to a career, but the low cost and easy enough interface of Arduinos enticed me to try coding with them anyways.",

The opportunity to work with my brother as well as learn the ins and outs of repairing electronics was too good to pass, it seemed like a nice bridge into a tech career. Eager to put my Python Coding skills to the test, I began programming some 'hello world' arduino circuits as well as designing a few projects of my own. I was so invested in testing my new ideas that I actually walled off a third of my parents’ garage, which built a small workshop for projects.",

Since college I have had an interest in environmental conservation and trends like the Slow Food Movement. So I combined the programming and hardware skills I had been studying to create automated indoor gardening systems. With time my projects ranged from simple Home Depot buckets with small pumps for watering plants, to a fully automated aquaponic system that filled the entire room, and eventually even a condensed refrigerator sized food computer equipped with a filter of microbes to organically fertilize the enclosed plants. Over the course of two years I grew comfortable programming arduinos to integrate with sensors and actuators as well as post and request data from the internet.",

Florida Poly is an excellent school with great opportunities, but I quickly realized another 4 years of university was not the best route forward for me.",

The camp was very intensive and emphasized collaboration and coding real world relevant projects. Since graduating the camp my skills, knowledge, and confidence as a developer have skyrocketed, yet I know my journey as a young junior developer has only just begun.",

I documented the early prototypes deveopment and wrote a technical report to the Antler NY technology leader. I unfortunately did not receive an investment, but it was an excellent learning experience.`,
