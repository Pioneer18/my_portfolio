                <p>This is the body section of our blog post. In this section I will write about things. I will be using the <abbr title="Hyper Text Markup Language">HTML</abbr>tags I have been learning how to code.</p>
                <p>This is <span>another paragraph</span>, and I would like to quote te late, great Martin Luther King, Jr. who once said <q>I have a dream</q>.</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>I am happy to join with you today in what will go down in history as the greatest demonstration for freedom in the history of our nation.</p>
                    <p>Five score years ago, a great American, in whose symbolic shadow we stand today, signed the Emancipation Proclamation. This momentous decree came as a great beacon light of hope to millions of Negro slaves who had been seared in the flames of withering injustice. It came as a joyous daybreak to end the long night of their captivity.</p>
