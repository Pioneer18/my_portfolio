                <P>
                    Majestic Casual is not a band, or even a single musician or group, it is a <q>carefully selected collection of things</q> admired by a German youtuber that goes by Nick. Nick founded the channel in 2011 because he was tired of listening to the monotonous commercial music that is played in endless loops on the radio and mainstream music channels. Nick did not start Majestic Casual to pontificate his particular taste in music but to share authentic and diverse music that he believed would spark the emotions and memories of his followers. His working philosophy for Majestic Casual is that <q>A person should not be in the center of the brand but the artists and their work</q>. 
                </P>
                <p>
                    The success of the channel lies not only in the truly unique mix of chill EDM, hip-hop, and alternative selections of musicians and songs but also with the captivatingly appropriate imagery paired with each song. <q>I like having what we call <em id="kopfkino"><a target="_blank" href="http://www.dw.com/en/word-of-the-week-kopfkino/a-17638891">Kopfkino</a></em> in Germany: listening to a track and imagining a movie scene. That's what I try to give my subscribers,</q> says Nick. Nick is certainly bringing some solid musical flavor to the masses, and his channel Majestic Casual now boast over 3.8 million subscribers while bringing in as much as $1.2 million dollars in revenue a year. I have been studying and chillinâ€™ out to Majestic Casual tunes since its birth in 2011 and plan to keep on listening for many more years to come.
