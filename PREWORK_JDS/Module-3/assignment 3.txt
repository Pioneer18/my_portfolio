Since graduating from college, I have been on a crusade of self study and exploration, tackling challenge after challenge. Through my efforts I have become accustomed to sticking it out when the going gets tough, and I have come to believe nearly nothing is impossible. Strong internal confidence is invaluable for success, however I recognize that it can impede success as well. Without a doubt, if i intend to truly gain from this boot camp and excel, I will need to consciously temper my hubris and approach the boot camp with the respect that it deserves. 
‘Finding a squad,’ also may be a small challenge since I have become accustomed to studying and working on my own in recent years. However, I have played team sports all my life and I am not a shy person. I will make a deliberate effort to be social and collaborative.
