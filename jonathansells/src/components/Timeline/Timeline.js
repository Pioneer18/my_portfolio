                                <p>I was not always a tech person, In fact I daul majored in international politics & Japanese Language and Literature. However, by my senior year, I decided against pursuing a political career and began searching for other possible career paths. During my final semester of college I took an introduction to Python course and found that I am far more interested in technology than politics.</p>

                                <p>After graduating from W&mp;L I was still unsure of what to do with my recently sparked interest in programming, so I chose to teach English in Japan for a year. While teaching, exploring, and soaking up the experiences of Japan, I continued to work through the exercises in my intro to Python textbook and I also began to study HTML and CSS. I relied on resources like Udemy, Codecademy, and Khan Academy to dive deeper into programming fundamentals, and I also discovered a new interest in Arduinos by reading coding blogs and forums. I wasnâ€™t sure that programming microcontrollers could lead to a career, but the low cost and easy enough interface of Arduinos enticed me to try coding with them anyways.</p>
